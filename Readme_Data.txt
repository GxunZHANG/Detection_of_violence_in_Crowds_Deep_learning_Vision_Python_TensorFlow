This is a Readme for the data being used for this project, the data used here
initially are video files collected from the following url-

http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/data/violentflows/

The data extracted is split into 5 folders each containing seperate folders for 
violence and non-violence and the 5 parts defining the type of videos inside like, 
sporting event, concert etc. There is also a 6th folder with extra videos which
are not in the scope for this research.This data can be found at the link mentioned below-

The initial data then undergoes frame extraction and is then split into two huge folders
one for violence and second for non-violence each containing frames for that particular 
label. The violence folder contains 12407 images while thhe non-violence folder contains
9421 images. This data can be found at the link mentioned below-

After frame extraction the third and final part of the data is the scaled training and testing 
data split into a 70:30 train:test split and contains scaled down versions of the image frames.
